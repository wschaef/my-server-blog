# My "home server" project - blog

## Introduction

As an architect, I don't spend enough time coding. I think I have a relatively good knowledge of the theoretical concepts.

But:

> In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is a big difference

The idea is to set up a linux server at home and learn from it or gain practical experience.
Based on my experience with private coding projects, it is helpful to have a practical use case as a goal.

These use cases I have today in my mind:

* monitor network how long a device was online (yes I have kids)
* home automation
* backup for data 
* have more control about outgoing traffic from devices
* get notification if some was trying to attack my network
* ..

Non functional requirements:

* change hardware must be easy -> everithing as code 
* OS on the server is linux
* update should be automated
* ressource efficient
* no security shortcuts
* downtime of the server must not have any influence of happyness of my family
